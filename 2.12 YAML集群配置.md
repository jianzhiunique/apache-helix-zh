# YAML集群配置

除了使用helix admin来配置集群、资源、约束、状态模型外，还有另外的选择，helix支持通过YAML配置文件来引导一个集群。以下是一个带有注释的例子，是一个简单的分布式锁管理器的例子，一个锁只能是LOCKED和RELEASED状态，每个锁只能允许单个参与者持有，处于LOCKED状态。

```
clusterName: lock-manager-custom-rebalancer # unique name for the cluster (required)
resources:
  - name: lock-group # unique resource name (required)
    rebalancer: # required
      mode: USER_DEFINED # required - USER_DEFINED means we will provide our own rebalancer
      class: org.apache.helix.userdefinedrebalancer.LockManagerRebalancer # required for USER_DEFINED
    partitions:
      count: 12 # number of partitions for the resource (default is 1)
      replicas: 1 # number of replicas per partition (default is 1)
    stateModel:
      name: lock-unlock # model name (required)
      states: [LOCKED, RELEASED, DROPPED] # the list of possible states (required if model not built-in)
      transitions: # the list of possible transitions (required if model not built-in)
        - name: Unlock
          from: LOCKED
          to: RELEASED
        - name: Lock
          from: RELEASED
          to: LOCKED
        - name: DropLock
          from: LOCKED
          to: DROPPED
        - name: DropUnlock
          from: RELEASED
          to: DROPPED
        - name: Undrop
          from: DROPPED
          to: RELEASED
      initialState: RELEASED # (required if model not built-in)
    constraints:
      state:
        counts: # maximum number of replicas of a partition that can be in each state (required if model not built-in)
          - name: LOCKED
            count: "1"
          - name: RELEASED
            count: "-1"
          - name: DROPPED
            count: "-1"
        priorityList: [LOCKED, RELEASED, DROPPED] # states in order of priority (all priorities equal if not specified)
      transition: # transitions priority to enforce order that transitions occur
        priorityList: [Unlock, Lock, Undrop, DropUnlock, DropLock] # all priorities equal if not specified
participants: # list of nodes that can serve replicas (optional if dynamic joining is active, required otherwise)
  - name: localhost_12001
    host: localhost
    port: 12001
  - name: localhost_12002
    host: localhost
    port: 12002
  - name: localhost_12003
    host: localhost
    port: 12003
```

用以下的命令行和配置文件一起

```
helix/helix-core/target/helix-core/pkg/bin/YAMLClusterSetup.sh localhost:2199 lock-manager-config.yaml
```

要么使用代码

```
YAMLClusterSetup setup = new YAMLClusterSetup(zkAddress);
InputStream input =
    Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader()
        .getResourceAsStream("lock-manager-config.yaml");
YAMLClusterSetup.YAMLClusterConfig config = setup.setupCluster(input);
```

一些注意的点：

重平衡类只有在USER_DEFINED模式下需要，否则忽略

内建状态模型，像是OnlineOffline, LeaderStandby, and MasterSlave，或者那些已经被添加过的，只需要状态模型的名字。如果分区、副本数没有提供，默认值是1
